# Phase 2: EPR Configuration Tuning
# Based on performance audit showing systematic early bias on high-peak games

# EPR (Early Peak Regime) Settings
# Previous: 3.0, Recommended: 2.8 (activate EPR earlier)
EPR_RATIO_THRESHOLD=2.8

# Previous: 0.75, Recommended: 0.70 (stronger hazard suppression)
EPR_HAZARD_SCALE=0.70

# Decay tau - consider increasing to 160 if still seeing early bias
EPR_HAZARD_DECAY_TAU=120

# Minimum quantile for EPR-active predictions
EPR_QUANTILE_WIDE_SPREAD=0.70

# Trigger "wide spread" earlier
EPR_SPREAD_WIDE=150

# Note: Add +0.02 when EPR active, +0.05 for 10x peaks (implement in code)
