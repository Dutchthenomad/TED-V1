# Side-Bet Patch Integration Summary

## ✅ Patch Successfully Applied

Date: 2025-08-13
Version: Hazard-Sidebet + Tolerance Quantization

## Changes Applied

### 1. **game_aware_ml_engine.py**
- ✅ Added `side_bet_signal()` method for hazard-based side-bet recommendations
- Uses hazard head to compute P(rug within next 40 ticks)
- EV calculation: `EV = 4*p_win - (1-p_win)` for 5x gross payout
- Action threshold configurable via `SIDEBET_PWIN_THRESHOLD` (default 0.20)

### 2. **server.py** 

#### Environment Constants Added:
- ✅ `SIDEBET_WINDOW_TICKS` (default 40)
- ✅ `SIDEBET_COOLDOWN_TICKS` (default 4)  
- ✅ `SIDEBET_PWIN_THRESHOLD` (default 0.20)

#### Core Improvements:
- ✅ **Tolerance Quantization**: Added `_quantize_prediction_tolerance()` method
  - Ensures predictions don't extend into the past
  - Aligns tolerance to 40-tick windows (multiple of 20)
  - Adds coverage fields: `coverage_lower`, `coverage_upper`, `coverage_windows`

- ✅ **Gating Logic**: Prevents rapid-fire recommendations
  - Tracks `last_side_bet_tick` and `last_side_bet_active_until`
  - Enforces 40+4 tick spacing between recommendations

- ✅ **Fixed Win Evaluation**: Corrected side-bet win logic
  - Win condition: `final_tick <= placement_tick + 40`
  - Previously incorrectly checked `final_tick <= 40` overall

- ✅ **History Retention**: Increased `side_bet_history` from 100 to 200

#### API Updates:
- ✅ REST endpoint `/api/side-bet` now uses hazard-based signal
- ✅ WebSocket `side_bet` message uses new signal method
- ✅ Returns additional fields: `p_win_40`, `coverage_end_tick`

### 3. **Test Files Created**
- ✅ `tests/test_sidebet.py` - Unit tests for patch logic
- ✅ `test_patch_smoke.py` - Smoke test verifying patch application

## Verification Results

All 13 patch components verified:
- Hazard-based side_bet_signal method ✅
- Environment constants (3) ✅
- Tolerance quantization ✅
- Gating state variables (2) ✅
- Side bet history size ✅
- New hazard-based calls ✅
- Corrected win evaluation ✅
- Updated endpoints ✅
- Coverage calculations (2) ✅

## Configuration

### Default Settings
```bash
SIDEBET_WINDOW_TICKS=40      # Side bet window duration
SIDEBET_COOLDOWN_TICKS=4     # Cooldown after window expires
SIDEBET_PWIN_THRESHOLD=0.20  # Min probability to recommend bet
```

### Production Tuning
- Consider `SIDEBET_PWIN_THRESHOLD=0.22` initially for conservative approach
- Monitor calibration and adjust based on actual win rates

## Key Improvements

1. **Correct Math**: Side bets now properly evaluated relative to placement time
2. **Throughout Game**: Recommendations available at any tick (not just early)
3. **Hazard-Based**: Uses survival analysis for better probability estimates
4. **Proper Gating**: 40+4 tick spacing prevents overlapping bets
5. **Time-Real Tolerance**: Predictions never extend into the past
6. **Window Alignment**: Tolerance quantized to 40-tick side-bet windows

## Monitoring Recommendations

Track these metrics post-deployment:
1. Side-bet calibration: Compare predicted vs actual win rates
2. Conformal coverage: Should maintain ~85% target
3. Drift detector triggers
4. EV performance over time

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:
1. Increase `SIDEBET_PWIN_THRESHOLD` to 0.25+ for immediate safety
2. The legacy `get_side_bet_recommendation()` remains intact
3. Can revert to early-only recommendations by restoring old logic

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to staging environment
2. Monitor calibration for 100+ games
3. Adjust thresholds based on empirical performance
4. Consider adding isotonic/Platt calibration for p_win_40

## Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT ✅

All changes are non-destructive and maintain backward compatibility.
The system is ready for testing in your development environment.
