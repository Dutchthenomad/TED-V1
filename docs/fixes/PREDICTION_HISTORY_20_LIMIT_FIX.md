# Prediction History 20-Game Limit Fix

## Problem Discovered
You were only able to see a maximum of 20 games in the prediction history window, regardless of the dropdown selection or actual data available.

## Root Causes Found

### 1. **Hardcoded [-20:] Limits in Backend** ❌
Found THREE places where the backend was limiting prediction history to last 20 entries:
- Line 229: `'prediction_history': list(self.prediction_history)[-20:]`
- Line 557: `'prediction_history': list(pattern_tracker.prediction_history)[-20:]`
- Line 697: `"prediction_history": list(pattern_tracker.prediction_history)[-20:]`

### 2. **API Endpoint Issues** ❌
- Default limit was 50, not 200
- Returning `"records"` key instead of `"history"` 
- Frontend expecting `data.history` but backend sending `data.records`

### 3. **Data Flow Problem** ❌
```
Backend Memory (200 entries) → Sliced to 20 → WebSocket → Frontend
                            ↑
                    BOTTLENECK HERE!
```

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Changes (`server.py`)

#### 1. Fixed `/api/prediction-history` endpoint:
```python
# Before
@app.get("/api/prediction-history")
async def get_prediction_history(limit: int = 50):
    ...
    return {
        "records": records,  # Wrong key!

# After
@app.get("/api/prediction-history")
async def get_prediction_history(limit: int = 200):
    ...
    return {
        "history": records,  # Matches frontend expectation
```

#### 2. Removed ALL hardcoded [-20:] limits:
```python
# Before (3 occurrences)
'prediction_history': list(self.prediction_history)[-20:]

# After (all 3 fixed)
'prediction_history': list(self.prediction_history)  # Send full history
```

## System Health Check

### Memory Configuration ✅
- `self.prediction_history = deque(maxlen=200)` - Correctly configured
- `self.side_bet_history = deque(maxlen=200)` - Correctly configured

### Data Flow (After Fix) ✅
```
Backend Memory (200 entries) → Full List → WebSocket → Frontend
                            ↓
                    /api/prediction-history
                            ↓
                    Full 200 entries
```

### Frontend Configuration ✅
- Dropdown: 20, 50, 100, 200 options
- Display: Properly slices based on selection
- Polling: Fetches from `/api/prediction-history` every 45s

## How It Works Now

1. **Backend Stores**: Up to 200 game predictions in memory
2. **WebSocket Sends**: Full history (up to 200 entries)
3. **REST API Returns**: Full history (up to 200 entries)
4. **Frontend Receives**: All available data
5. **User Selects**: 20, 50, 100, or 200 to display
6. **Table Shows**: Exactly what user selected (if available)

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Backend Data**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/prediction-history
   # Should see "history" key with up to 200 entries
   ```

2. **Check WebSocket Messages**:
   - Open browser DevTools → Network → WS
   - Look for `prediction_history` in messages
   - Should contain full array, not limited to 20

3. **Frontend Display**:
   - Should show "showing 20 of X" where X can be >20
   - Changing dropdown to 50/100/200 should show more rows
   - Scroll bar should appear when needed

## What Was Happening Before

```
You had 150 games played
Backend stored all 150 (up to 200 max)
But WebSocket only sent last 20
Frontend received 20
Display showed "20 of 20"
Dropdown changes had no effect (only 20 available)
```

## What Happens Now

```
You have 150 games played
Backend stores all 150
WebSocket sends all 150
Frontend receives all 150
Display shows "showing 20 of 150" (default)
Dropdown to 100 → shows "showing 100 of 150"
Dropdown to 200 → shows "showing 150 of 150"
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: 200 games × ~200 bytes = ~40KB (negligible)
- **Network**: Full history sent once, then updates only
- **Rendering**: Frontend only renders what's selected (20/50/100/200)

## Status: FIXED ✅

The artificial 20-game limit has been completely removed. The system now properly:
- Stores up to 200 games in backend memory
- Sends full history via WebSocket and REST
- Allows frontend to display any subset the user selects
- Shows accurate counts in the UI

You should now be able to see your full prediction history (up to 200 games)!
